<h1>The Best Movies According to Ubong</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The king</h3>
<p>This is my favourite and most recent of all three. The movie starrs Timothy Chalamet. It's Intriguing, epic (I love epic movies) and well-written. Anyone would love it i'm sure.  </p>
<h3>The Rise of the Phoenixes</h3>
<p>Another epic masterpiece. This movie is a combination of beautiful scenery (Asian movies seem to always have wonderful scenery by the way) and amazing storytelling.</p>

<h3>The Lords of the Rings</h3>

<p>This my most watched movie ever. I have probably watched it 20+ times including it's recent series called "The hobbit". This is J.R.R tolkien's masterpiece indeed. </p>
